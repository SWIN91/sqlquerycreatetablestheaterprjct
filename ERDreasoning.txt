My reasoning was as follows:

There's always only ever one customer, but in order to see a movie, that customer will always need a minimum of one ticket. The customer can purchase as many tickets
as desired.
The customer may or may not choose to indulge in concessions. If the customer does choose to do so, concessions can be as many as the customer wants.
The customer is also free to choose to see/purchase tickets for only one movie or as many movies as desired.
